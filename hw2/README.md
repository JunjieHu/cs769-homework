# HW 2: Project Proposal Review

## Logistics
The class project will be carried out in groups of 3 or 4 people. Please actively search your teammate either posting a note on piazza or chatting after class. Every team has 3 late days in total for HW 2, 4 and 5.

## Submission Information
In **Homework 2**, you should also turn in a brief report (project proposal) that provides an overview of your idea and also contains a brief survey of related work on the topic. Please submit the following file to Canvas.


- **a report (HW 2)**: This should be named "report.pdf". This is for HW 2, and can be **up to 3 pages**. References are not included in the page count. Submissions that exceed the page count will be penalized one third grade (33%) for each page over. The report must use the official ACL style templates, which are available from [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) (Latex and Word). Please follow the paper formatting guidelines general to *ACL* conferences available [here](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html). The proposal report should include the following information:

    - Project title and list of group members.
    - Overview of project idea. This should be approximately 0.5 page long.
    - A short literature survey of 4 or more relevant papers. The literature review should take up approximately one page.
    - Description of potential methods beyond the existing work. This should be approximately one page long.
    - Description of potential data sets to use for your experiments, the experimental settings, and the experiments to be conducted. This should be approximately one page long.
    - Plan of activities, including what you plan to complete by the final report and how you plan to divide up the work among the group members. This should be approximately one page long.


## Grading
The grading breakdown for the proposal is as follows:

- 25% for clear and concise description of proposed method
- 25% for literature survey that covers at least 4 relevant papers
- 25% for plan of activities
- 25% for quality of writing
